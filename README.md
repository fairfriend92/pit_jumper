# pit_jumper
Repository for the scripts and assets of the Pit Jumper game. Everything made by me, game engine is Unity.

This is the repository structure:
- Art contains some assets I made that were later reworked in actual stuff used within the game
- Assets contains everything I made, from scripts to sprites and backgrounds, that the game actually uses. In particular you have:
  - Backgrounds: the levels 2D backgrounds on which the player moves...
  - Objects: Unity entities made of a combination of scripts and sprites
  - Resources: Assets that must be accessed in real-time, such as fonts
  - Scenes: Unity levels
  - Scripts: C# scripts with game logic
  - Sprites: Objects sprites
  - Tiles: Textures that make up the levels backgrounds
